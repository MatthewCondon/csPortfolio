      <font size="+3">September 24, 2021 - My first entry <br>
      <font size="+1">
      Welcome to my blog. This is my first entry, as you can tell by the title. This will be a learning experience for you and me, as I've never written a blog and you get to watch me now! School was fun today. I have a few quizzes and tests next week, which have got me a bit nervous. I also cleaned up some code in this portfolio. Overall, today was a good day. Hopefully I will have some more to talk about in future blogs.

      <font size="+3">September 26, 2021 - What to do? <br>
      <font size="+1">
      I'll admit that I'm at a stalemate with what to add to this portfolio. I don't really know what else I can add to it at this point. I feel like I've added everything, yet I still feel like there is something that it is missing. Perhaps I will think of it soon. In the meantime, I am interested in adding a live date and time that (a) continuously updates down to the second and (b) slides across the screen using the Marquee element. I know how to use the Marquee element after some experimentation, but I may need Dr. R to help with the live time data.
      <br>
      UPDATE: I am also going to begin work the Contact Me page. I found the code to do it, I just don't know how to send a message from the portfolio to the gmail account I plan on making.

      <font size="+3">September 27, 2021 - Homecoming Week <br>
      <font size="+1">
      Today marked the beginning of Homecoming week for school. Today is Pajama Day. Tomorrow is Neon Day, Wednesday is Occupation Day, Thursday is Irish-Out, and Friday is Western Day. It all sounds like it will be a pretty fun week.
      <br>
      I got called up to Varsity in Cross Country for our meet at Osseo on Thursday. I'm pretty excited for that. Looking forward to hopefully running a good time on a fast course.

            <font size="+3">October 5, 2021 - Spooky Changes to the Website <br>
      <font size="+1">
      Happy October! One of my favorite months for one of my favorite holidays. I love Halloween, especially when it comes to horror movies and scary decorations. I am not sure why, I just really like it.
      <br>
      Anyways, back to the portfolio. I titled it "Spooky" because today I had to initiate a massive change to the portfolio. Essentially, I had four projects to show in CSA, but I could only show three due to the size of the clock and holiday card. So, I created new pages. Easy enough, right? Not really. I had to change the menu for all the pages, create new CSS files, design all the new pages, link the pages, and a lot more. There were also some changes made to the menu that I wanted to make anyways, like a sideways arrow on the sub-menu. All those tasks are just about done, but I think I am gonna check in with Dr. R about it.
      <br>
      I knew I would have to have big maintenance for the site because this morning Dr. R said I would have to do something called refactoring. My GitHub site was not working because CSS files were not properly linked, so I would have to go back and change the files to call them correctly. Like before, though, it should be just about done.
