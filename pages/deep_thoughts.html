      <font size="+3">September 24, 2021 - Poptarts vs Tacos <br>
      <font size="+1">
        You probably think this is a weird concept. <em> How could a Poptart be classified as a taco?</em> Just think about it, though. How is a taco formed? You have the shell that goes under and rises on the sides. You also have all the "good stuff" on the inside and salsa on top. Think about how a Poptart is created now. You have the crust that goes under and rises on the sides. You get all the "good stuff" on the inside. Lastly, you have got the frosting to top it all off. Don't believe me? Look up a picture of a Poptart and Taco. You will see where I am coming from.

      <font size="+3">September 29, 2021 - Immovable Object vs All-powerful God<br>
      <font size="+1">
        I find this to be an interesting paradox. Let's assume there is an all-powerful God that can do anything. Anything that he imagines is possible can happen. There is someone who asks that God to create an immovable rock. This is where the paradox comes into play. The God can create that rock, but then the God would not be all-powerful in that they couldn't move the rock. The God can also choose to not create the rock, but then they would not be all-powerful in that they could not make the immovable rock. So the question stands: <em>Can an all-powerful God create an immovable object?</em>

      <font size="+3">October 19, 2021 - The Law of Conservation of Matter<br>
      <font size="+1">
        Let us first remind ourselves what the Law of Conservation of Matter is: matter cannot be created nor destroyed; in a closed system, it will be used again at some point. Given that Earth is a closed system, does that mean I was once a dinosaur? Were you once a winning lottery ticket? If matter will always be reused in our Earth's closed system, and knowing that matter can change forms, theoretically, we were all something else at some point in history.

      <font size="+3">November 21, 2021 - Space<br>
      <font size="+1">
        I haven't done an entry for a while, so here's a sandwich of thoughts.
        
        Space is an interesting topic. I think there are a lot of deep thoughts. Here are some of mine:
        <br>- <em>Do aliens exist?</em> There's not really a reasonable explanation for denying their existence aside from the fact we haven't seen them. There's a chance we've contacted them, even if by accident (Think the wow! signal). Perhaps they aren't in our solar system. They could be in another galaxy. Yes, there is a small chance for life to be created, like how Earth was. However, with the size of the universe, you have to admit the chances are a lot higher than we think.
        <br>- <em>Are parallel universes real?</em> This is unproven, so its harder to argue. I just think it would be cool if parallel universes existed. There's the universe I exist in. There's the universe where I am the richest man in the world. There's the universe where I invented Computer Science and Programming. I just think the possibility of parallel universes existing is fun to imagine.
